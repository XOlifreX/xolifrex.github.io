            <br/>Gaming is a big part of my life! My most favourite thing to do in my free time!
            <br/>Here are some gaming topic I'd like to highlight I deeply care about! :)
          </p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Reverse engineering</h2>
          <p>
            I love programming, but I don't necessarily use this skill all the times to build things. I really enjoy finding secrets and things you're not supposed to see in existing application, more specifically games.
          </p>
          <p>
          One of the projects that's centered around that is my Mario Kart Advance decompilation project. Decompiling means translating the machine code of the application back to a higher level language like C, or w/e the application was originally written in. You would do this by analysing pieces of assembly code and try to write equivalent C code that would output the same assembly code. Once it's matching, you know you've written code that will do exactly the same the original does.
          </p>
          <p>
            By decompiling games, you not only will better understand how the game works, but also find secrets and unused pieces of code and functionality. Without performing reverse engineering, you would never have known about these things. Some games hide more things than others, it's a very interesting process to go through to hopefully find in the end things the original developers never intended for you, the end consumer, to see. :)
          </p>
          <p>
            As I said, I do this for the GBA game Mario Kart Advance and also for the GBA game Hamtaro: Ham Ham Games. Mario Kart I do for recovering its long lost Japan-only online functionality via the Mobile Adapter GB peripheral, and Hamtaro I do for nostalgic reasons. I'm not super active on these projects, the activity goes up and down whenever I have motivation as it's a lot of repetative work which drains you quickly, especially if you're working on it alone, haha!
          </p>
          <p>
            I think decompilation projects in general are a great thing! It makes sure that the application is preserved and will exist for ever in any state you want. Because decompilations usually happen on closed-source applications, it will make them then open-source in a legal way as the code that is gotten from the decompilation won't be the same code exactly. It's sort of like with companies that make e.g. microwave systems. They all sure do the same, but one company has written the code in a different way than another company. So, the act of decompilation is legal, what's not legal is using the intelectual property of the company like visuals, music and the likes and distribute those along with the decompiled code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of decompilation, you will get a source that will output the same exact program, but that means you will have freedom over the code, so porting would become a possibility! For example, the N64 game Super Mario 64 was fully decompiled, and now you see that game running natively on other platforms like the Switch or a PC without emulation. Decompilations make sure any application is open and anyone can do with it what it wants.
          </p>
          <p>
            I follow the decompilation scene very closely, I find all of this stuff very interesting and really exciting!
