          <h1>Video Games</h1>
          <p>
            <br/>Gaming is a big part of my life! My most favorite thing to do in my free time!
            <br/>Here are some gaming topic I'd like to highlight I deeply care about! :)
          </p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Mario Kart</h2>
          <p>
            Not going to touch this one too much as I cover Mario Kart in detail in my <a href="mariokart.html">Mario Kart page</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The game I play the most by far is Mario Kart Wii. Even though Nintendo's online service Wifi shut down in May 2014 we're still able to play online no problem via a community driven online service called Wiimmfi. 
            <br/>We load Mario Kart Wii via the CTGP-R Channel which adds a ton of Custom Tracks and the Wiimmfi service to play online again. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides Mario Kart Wii, I have played Mario Kart 7 & Mario Kart 8 pretty actively back when they came out and were more relevant. I mostly focused on Time Trails and less on online.
            <br/>Lastly, Mario Kart Super Ciruit, Mario Kart Double Dash & Mario Kart DS will always have a special place in my heart as I grew to love this franchise because of these games when I was a kid. I do time trail Mario Kart Super Circuit semi-seriously, though haven't done so in a while.
          </p>

          <h2>osu! Taiko</h2>
          <p>
            A game I like to play when I'm bored. A rythm game you can play mindlessly, listening to great music while playing something that requires skill. Osu! is a pretty competitive game with rankings for each song and overall country rankings, which drew me even closer as directly being able to compete against others in my own country is something that almost no other game has!  
            <br/>In osu! you can play four different rythm game modes. My favorite mode is the Taiko mode where you hit the red and blue notes in the rythm. Each color can be hit with two keys, so you can alternate if it gets pretty fast!
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Taiko mode I'm currently ranked <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/taiko/performance?country=BE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 of Belgium</a> since January 2016 and currently sitting in the Top 400 worldwide.
            <br/>I sometimes participate in online tournaments against other top Taiko players of the world. I don't perform the best there, though I still realy enjoy it!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can check out my osu! profile <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4328137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>! :)

          <h2>Pokémon GO</h2>
          <p>
            when I'm out of the house, Pokémon GO is usually on. Have been playing since the start in 2016 and never stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to be pretty hardcore, but have since slowed down considerably. Currently I focus on the ingame events, catch the newly released Pokémon and raid when a new or super strong legendary is available.
            <br/>I'm a bit ashamed at how much I've spend on this game, hahaha!

          <h2>Super Mario Bros</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to Nintendo, Mario is the franchise I love the most! Grew up with Mario games and never stopped loving them!
          </p>
          <p>
            The first encounter with Mario was on the SNES with Super Mario World and Super Mario All Stars. Those two games will always have a special place in my heart! 
            <br/>Later on I got a Game Cube and a Wii where I played Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy! Those are absolutely amazing games and I revisit them quite often.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always been closely following the Mario games and where the franchise is heading. At the moment with how Mario Oddysey looked and played, I'm not the biggest fan of the direction Nintendo is taking Mario. I much prefere the art and style direction Mario was taken during the Gamecube era. Though it might just be me being nostalgic for those days, but I can't help feeling like this.
            <br/>However, I will always keep a close eye on the newest Mario games and play them! I don't think at this point in my life I'm ever going to fully stop loving the franchise, haha! 
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was young I used to draw level designs on paper for Super Mario World and other games. Once I found out ROM hacking existed for e.g. Super Mario World through the website SMWCentral, I was in love! I have spent many hours tinkering in Lunar Magic, haha!
            <br/>You can find my profile on SMWCentral <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=15499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, though there isn't too much on it! :)

          <br/>
          <h2>Pokémon</h2>
          <p>
            The whole Pokémon franchise I'm just as big of a fan of as the Mario franchise! Been a fan ever since I played Sapphire when it got released. Because of nostalgia, Hoenn is my favorite region! I can always find enjoyment replaying the GBA Gen 3 games, especially Emerald with its amazing Battle Frontier post-game!
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like with Mario, I'm not too fond of the direction Pokémon is heading! Game Freak is making great games, but Pokémon literally being the biggest video game franchise in the world, you'd expect them to make insane open-world the sky is the limit games!? But that's sadly not the case, overall the games have average finishing touches and make inovation on the wrong sides that fans don't care about. One day I hope to see Pokémon release a game that follows the fans their desires. I mean, the fans are the ones who actually Play the games, a general widespread idea and mindset of fans usually is the best direction to take a franchise, so why ignore it??? It will never make sense to me. :(
          </p>
          <p>
            I have played every mainline Pokémon game and will continue to do so for as long Pokémon exist! :)

          <h2>Sonic The Hedgehog</h2>
          <p>
            Before Mario became a bigger part of my life, Sonic was actually my favorite franchise! I got introduced to Sonic via Sonic Heroes on the PlayStation 2 in 2005. That game unironicly taught me how to do 3D platformers effectively as I found that game insanely hard! Now it's one of my favorites, one which I frequently revisit for fun! Probably a lot of nostalgia bias, but it's how I feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've kept up with every Sonic game that was released and onwards. Even fell in love with the older games from the Genesis, especially Sonic 2 and 3&Knucles. I got introduced to them via Sonic Mega Collection Plus on the PC. That game honestly really sparked the ultimate Sonic fan in me cause via its Extra content I found out here's tons and tons of extra Sonic content and lore I had no idea about! Apparently Sonic comics exist!!!! And they're somewhat cannon!!! I couldn't believe it, the fanboi in me really sprung to life, hahaha! Though since I live in Belgium I couldn't get any comics as they're US only... Over the years I imported some to Belgium so I could enjoy a snippet of what was out there. Obviously nowadays I torrented the whole comic series on my phone and it has been such a pleasure to finally read the whole thing!
          </p>
          <p>
            More about the comics, I'm super sad about he way how Archie had handled Sonic in the later years. Especially with everything around the losing rights on a ton of characters like Julie-su... A big part of the characters that I truly enjoyed and gave me so much inspiration and love for the series... Oh well, the Archie era is over and now IDW is doing the comics. They're fine, but they absolutely don't give the same magic feeling that the Archie comics give. SEGA is a bit too hands on in the comics which limits the creative freedom the writers and artists can have compared to what Archie had. Archie comics will be forever in my heart and will remember those story fondly! :)
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not super pleased with how Sonic has been ever since after Generations. All we want as Sonic fans are games just like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle & Shadow The Hedgehog!!! That universe was sooooo goood! Shounen like stories work very well for Sonic, so please bring it back. :( Maybe some day we'll see it coming back, but until then I will follow the Sonic games with a close eye!

          <h2>Arcades</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a big arcade fan! Where I live there sadly aren't any arcade venues, but at the coast there are a few and that's where I really found my liking for them! My dream is to have my very own arcade machine of one of my favorite games. Will be expensive and hard to find, haha! :)
          </p>
          <p>
            The game that drew me to arcades was Outrun 2. I liked the arcade style gameplay of the game, but it was still a game that required skill. I loved the idea that you could be good at a game, set a great time and then have your name shown in the rankings for all that pass by the arcade machine. That competitive side of me showed up which made me even play more!  
          </p>
          <p>
            Other arcade games like the Mario Kart Arcade GP series realy interested me too! Sadly I only found a few of them ever. Most of the time just randomly in arcade venues I find while on vacation. But man, when I find one it's the best time ever! The latest Mario Kart Arcade GP game I played was the DX one which was in Disleyland Paris in Dec 2019. Good times! Nowadays I enjoy those games on the Dolphin emulator and TeknoParrot if I can't wait to find them in real venues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of TeknoParrot, I play the Initial D arcade games via TeknoParrot. In 2017 I got introduced to the Initial D games, skillfull racing games with amazing music! I'm an unironic Eurobeat lover, so having a skillfull game with such music was an instant click for me. Sort of why osu! interested me so much!
            <br/>I only play Arcade Stage 8 Infinity at the moment. By far my favorite out of all of them. the physics are absolutely insane, but that makes the game interesting! The drifting techniques to go faster is super hard, like realy hard. Gives me a good challenge to master them and become the best of my area!!
            
            <br/>Last but not least, Taiko is also originaly an arcade game! I sadly haven't experienced Taiko on the arcade yet. The closest thing was using the Wii Taiko drums I imported from Japan and playing Taiko on the Wii... They don't work well at all... So I hope the drums on real arcades are much better. One day when I make my trip to Japan I'll be sure to try out the Taiko arcades there! :)

          <h2>Retro gaming & Emulation</h2>
          <p>
            Over the years I grew to like retro gaming a lot more. More specifically the SNES, GBA and GCN era. though, GBA & GCN isn't considered to be retro, it soon will be. It holds a lot of nostalgic value for me, so I'm slowly becoming a small collector for those consoles. 
            <br/>I don't collect everything the consoles have to offer, but I focus on games and accessories that I find interesting! Like for example Pokémon Box on the GCN. That cost me €150, but I'm so happy I finally own a copy. Or the Mobile Adapter GB which allowed a Gameboy to connect to the internet. Or the Gamecube Hori Pad, I payed almost €300 for that, but I wanted to have that thing for so long and now I have it in my collection! :)
            <br>Sadly, the current setup in my room at home I don't have a good way to showcase my collection. In the future I want to make sure I have a good place to showcase everything in a nice way! And of course I will be sure to put a picture here, then! ;)
          </p>
          <p>
            Retro gaming goes further than just owning the consoles and buying interesting and expensive stuff. I realy care a lot about emulators! They're the coolest type of programs that exist!
            <br/>Console emulators literally allow older consoles, or any console really to exist for ever! Like ever, even if every single Gameboy in the world is broker, the emulators will continue to exist cause they're fully software. Emulators provide enhancements to the graphics sometimes and other fantastic features! I absolutely love and prefere playing my favorite games on emulators these days!
          </p>

          <h2>Others</h2>
          <p>
            I might be a full-on Nintendo fan, but that doesn't mean I only play that. I have other games that I absolutely love and care about on other platforms!
          </p>
          <p>
            The game that introduced me to PC gaming was the first Rollercoaster Tycoon. That game holds so much nostalgic value for me, it's a game I still play to this day, though it comes in waves. 
            <br/>I went from RCT1 to RCT2 and then to RCT3. Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 blew my mind when I first played it! You could actually ride all your attractions!!!! My 8 years old mind couldn't handle that, I was so hyped back then hahaha!
            <br/>Like I said, I still play RCT nowadays. Most of the time RCT1, though I use OpenRCT2 now to play RCT1 & 2 maps since it's an insanely good mod!
          </p>
          <p>
            Another franchise I deeply love is Danganronpa. I first watched the anime, then a year later I randomly decided to play the games and man, I fell in love, hahaha! The characters, the story, the atmosphere, everything!! I don't replay the games much, but I do enjoy it a lot to watch other ppl play it and see their reactions on everything!
          </p>
          <p>Minecraft is another game I realy started to like just recently. In 2019 I started playing on my brother's server and I just couldn't stop playing anymore. Before I didn't care about Minecraft at all, I thought it was a time waster, but now, oh noooo, now I waste my time on the game with pleasure, hahaha! When I play, I play on my private server I host for my family, though activity goes in waves too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now lastly, I'm not too big of a MMO RPG guy, but Guild Wars 2 and Genshin Impact are the exceptions.
            <br/>I started GW2 all the way back in 2013. I randomly picked it up cause the box art looked cool and yeah it was a cool game. I realy started playing it actively when a girl I liked from school played it too. I didn't understand anything about MMO or even RPG's at all, so it was a rough ride to finally understand what I had to do and what everything meant. Now I play it from time to time, but not actively at all.
            <br/>Genshin Impact on the other hand, mannnn that has realy caught my attention! I started playing in 2021, took a break in the summer and in the later half of 2021 I started again and I can't stop anymore. The anime fan in me cannot stop! But no, what realy surprised me was how good the game looks! Absolutely insane! The open world is also something I'm not used to. GW2 had semi-openworld, but you still had to move between loading zones, but that doens't exist in Genshin!

          <h2>Last comments</h2>
          <p>You can tell that I'm still stuck in the past with my game selection. It's realy hard for me for a new game to catch my attention, so I stick to the games I already like and get all my satisfaction out of.</p>
          <p>I'm big on nostalgia, I don't know what else to tell you, haha! :)</p>
