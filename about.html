          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Olivier Luyckx, a programmer with a fondness for reverse engineering,<br/>video game preservation, Mario Kart & Japanese.<br/>Did I say Mario Kart already?<br/></p>
          <p>Born in 1996, I currently live in Kapellen, Belgium. In 2018 I gratuated from Karel de Grote<br/>College University in Application Development and have found myself doing<br/>this as my daily job. To stay fit I swim twice a week, though I should probably<br/>do more than this.</p>
          <p>I like to spend my time in front of my desktop programming and playing video games.<br/>When I'm programming, ofen it's about something video game related, from reverse<br/>engineering GBA/Wii games to making mods/hacks for them. I'm particularly interested in decompilation projects, where you translate the static game binary asm code to C code to<br/>get, in the long term, a new readable, modifyable source code that will compile the original<br/>game. By doing this you'll disect the whole game and get to know literally everything about its inner workings and what every single byte represents. This is especially cool because this<br/>makes it possible to compile that game not for its original platform but to any platform you<br/>want! (Wii, GBA, PS5, PC, ...) In my eyes, this is the ultimate way to preserve video games, which<br/>I'm a die-hard fan of. Ever since the Nintendo Leaks of 2020 I became fully invested in game preservation. Outside of this reversing stuff I have an interest in game development,<br/>specifically about graphics programming. Currently I'm learning OpenGL/Vulkan and hope to master them to one day make my own games.</p>
          <p>When I'm not being productive, I like to play video games. As I mentioned, I'm a big Mario Kart fan, more specifically the Wii version.<br/>When people introduce me to others, Mario Kart is usually said within the same breath!<br/>I play in a semi-professional online team called Avail where we participate in online<br/>tournaments in the highest division. When I'm not playing tournaments, I play the Time Trail<br/>mode where I aim to achieve times that will fall in the European/Worldwide Top10.<br/>I still have many goals left, so I will be doing this for quite a while, haha!<br/>Currently I'm ranked #1 of Belgium in Mario Kart Wii, and was Belgian Mario Kart Champion<br/>for a few years officially recognized by Nintendo Benelux, which I'm particularly proud of!<br/>Maybe one day I'll get that title back. :-)</p>
