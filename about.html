          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Olivier Luyckx, a programmer with a fondness for reverse engineering, system emulation, video game preservation, Mario Kart & Japan.</p>
          <p>Born in 1996, I currently live in Kapellen, Belgium. In 2018 I gratuated from the Karel de Grote College University in Application Development and have found myself doing this as my daily job. To stay fit I swim twice a week, though I should probably do more than this.</p>
          <p>When I'm programming in my free time, often it's about something video game related, from reverse engineering GBA/Wii games to making mods/hacks for them. Currently I'm having fun decompiling GBA games and keeping up with other decompilation works on the internet. Outside of that I have an interest in game development, specifically about graphics programming. Currently I'm learning OpenGL/Vulkan and hope to master them to one day make my own games.</p>
          <p>When I'm not being productive, I like to play video games. I'm a big Mario Kart fan, more specifically the Wii version. When people introduce me to others, Mario Kart is usually said within the same breath! I play in a semi-professional online team called Avail where we participate in online tournaments in the highest division. Outside of tournaments, I play the Time Trail mode where I aim to achieve times that fall in the European/Worldwide Top10 rankings. Currently I'm ranked #1 of Belgium in Mario Kart Wii, and have been the Belgian Mario Kart Champion for a few years officially recognized by Nintendo Benelux, which I'm particularly proud of! Maybe one day I'll get that title back. :)</p>
